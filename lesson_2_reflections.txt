What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   Creates meta data. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

   Allows you to control commit content more finely. Allows you to make
   changes more freely before committing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

   Make changes in working directory. When one logical change is complete,
   stage it and commit it.
